As much as I love getting my hands on that new, shiny, (un)known malicious application or scratching that itch of clicking on those sketchy phishing emails I tell myself only idiots click on, the one thing I love more is knowing that after I get bored doing it, my machine will not be infected and that little voice in my head won&amp;rsquo;t be telling me that I need to, again, nuke my disk and re-install my OS.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it&amp;rsquo;s probably because you either follow me closely (which is a bit concerning), stumbled upon it randomly (what were you even searching for?), or I did something so incredible that you think everything I write is pure gold and MUST be read. Well, if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, let me burst your bubble: this post isn&amp;rsquo;t anything special.
Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I&amp;rsquo;m starting this blog or if this will be the first and last post.</description>
