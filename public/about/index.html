    <p><strong>Passionate and deeply focused</strong>, I thrive in the ever-evolving world of technology. With a <strong>degree in Computer and Telematics Engineering</strong> from the University of Aveiro, I&rsquo;ve expanded my horizons across various tech domains. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>web3 technologies</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>microcontrollers</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2022, I contributed to the <strong>FireTech project through an Undergraduate Student Research Scholarship</strong>, focusing on microcontroller network communication for <strong>wildfire detection</strong>. This experience solidified my commitment to leveraging technology for societal good. Since 2023, I advanced into a <strong>Graduate Research Scholarship</strong> focusing on the <strong>DevSecOps of a Software Defined Network controller</strong> for large-scale deployment in <em>quantum-safe</em> environments which will come in hand has I&rsquo;m currently pursuing a <strong>Master&rsquo;s in Cybersecurity</strong>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I tend to spend it <strong>developing my ideas</strong> (of which I seem never to get enough) for innovative systems and applications. I&rsquo;m also a volunteer firefighter and as such I tend to <strong>draw inspiration from my personal experiences in the field of rescue and crisis response</strong> for the development of tools that can aid me and others like me to get the job done well!</p>
