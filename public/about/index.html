    <p><strong>Highly motivated and obsessively focused</strong>, I guess, is the best way to describe me. I commit myself entirely to every single project I work on because, for me, software development is more than just my job; it is also my hobby and my passion. My main fields of interest are <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>web3 technologies</strong>, and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve been programming since I was 15, and from that point onward, I knew that technology was my vocation. Nowadays, I have the pleasure and opportunity of obtaining the Computer and Telematics Engineering bachelors at the <strong>University of Aveiro</strong>, which has broadened my view of this field and has been an amazing learning journey. Currently I attend the <strong>Master&rsquo;s in Cybersecurity</strong> course at the same university.</p>
<p>Professionally I&rsquo;ve started as an Undergraduate Student Researcher at <strong>Instituto de Telecomunicações</strong>&rsquo;s center at Aveiro in the field of microcontroller network communication for the <em>FireTech</em> project, which aims to develop a <strong>system of wildfire detection and population warning</strong> via existing fiber optics network and local radio station broadcast, respectively.  I&rsquo;ve since advanced into a <strong>Graduate Research Scholarship</strong> focusing on the DevSecOps of a <em>Software Defined Network</em> controller for large scale deployment in <strong><em>quantum-safe</em> environments</strong>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I tend to spend it <strong>developing my own ideas</strong> (of which I seem to never get enough) for innovative systems and applications. I&rsquo;m also a volunteer firefighter and as such I tend to <strong>draw inspiration from my personal experiences in the field of rescue and crisis response</strong> for the development of tools that can aid me and others like me to get the job done well!</p>
<p>And thats me!</p>
