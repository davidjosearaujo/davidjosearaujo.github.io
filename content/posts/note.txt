# Device file (block, character)

In Unix, almost all things are handled as files and have a location in the file system, even hardware devices like hard drives. The great exception is network devices, which do not turn up in the file system but are handled separately.

Device files are used to apply access rights to the devices and to direct operations on the files to the appropriate device drivers.

Unix makes a distinction between character devices and block devices. The distinction is roughly as follows:
- Character devices provide only a serial stream of input or accept a serial stream of output
- Block devices are randomly accessible

Although, for example, disk partitions may have both character devices that provide un-buffered random access to blocks on the partition and block devices that provide buffered random access to blocks on the partition.

A character device is marked with a c as the first letter of the mode string and a block device is marked with a b, e.g. in this abbreviated ls -l output

Talk about how you can access information about running processes by reading the files in /proc

First find PID of running process using top / htop, and then look for the dir with that name and read the status file inside it for more information

Also, you should read the cgroup and environ files
