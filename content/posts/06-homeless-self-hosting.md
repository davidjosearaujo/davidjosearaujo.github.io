# Has specific as it is simple

In this cookie-cutter world, we have managed to make yourself fit in whatever shaped fits the majority, although, one benefit of the constant growth of technologies is that in order for a tool to stand out it tries to solve a never before approached issue, and appeal to a never before heard niche. This constant reach for the edges and subdivision of the market in ever increasingly smaller group presents us with an also increasing change of finding the cookie that perfectly fits us.

This being said, there will never be a perfect solution. No requirement analysis of envisoned stakeholder will take into account my every need or preference, and it will come to a point where, if I have a specific problem, I'll have to come up with my specific solution. But I also can't fool myself. No, this probably is not a viable product. We like to think that _"I cannot be the only one with this problem"_ but the truth is, _"Yes"_, yes you can.

Because of this, a very simple issue with a very simple and attractive solution for me, can still not be a good product. Being as specific as it is simple, can be be the limiting factor of a good idea. But don't beat yourself up, it also doesn't mean the idea is not good!
